It's "live" in the sense that it allows direct interaction/inspection with/of all its elements. Everything in Zombie Kernel is an object that can be inspected and changed "live".

How to play with it
-------------------
Just drag "morphee-coffee.html" from the "build" directory into any browser and right click to open a system menu. The "demo" section has some elements that you can play with.
