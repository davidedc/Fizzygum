Fizzygum
========

Tired of stringing libraries together?
Try a new web framework that does complex things, easily.

Fizzygum is designed from the ground up to: 

✔ make dashboards and visualise data (plots, maps, …) 
✔ author, organise and navigate documents 
✔ insert dynamic calculations anywhere, via simple drag & drop 
✔ make custom utilities visually (no coding required) 
✔ use internal development tools to customise anything, as it runs
✔ do all of the above, concurrently
