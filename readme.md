Fizzygum
========

Fizzygum is a minimal live desktop system similar in concept to Squeak and Lively Kernel.

It's "live" in the sense that it allows direct interaction/inspection with/of all its elements. Everything in Fizzygum is an object that can be inspected and changed "live".

Play with it
-------------------
Try it [here](http://fizzygum.net)

Download it / build it
-------------------
Install npm. Then install coffeescript. Run the "build_it_please.sh" script. No server needed, just drag "index.html" from the "build" directory into any browser and right click to open a system menu. The "demo" section has some elements that you can play with.

Build it / Hack it
---------------------------------------------
TBD

Standing on the shoulders of giants
-----------------------------------
Fizzygum was inspired by [Lively Kernel](http://www.lively-kernel.org/).
Fizzygum was built starting from [Morphic.js](https://github.com/jmoenig/morphic.js) by [Jens MÃ¶nig](https://twitter.com/moenig).
