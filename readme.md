Zombie Kernel
============

Zombie Kernel is a minimal live desktop system similar in concept to Squeak and Lively Kernel.

It's "alive" in the sense that it allows direct interaction/inspection with/of all its elements. Everything in Zombie Kernel is an object that can be inspected and changed "live".
