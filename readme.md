Zombie Kernel
============

Zombie Kernel is a minimal live desktop system similar in concept to Squeak and Lively Kernel.

It's "live" in the sense that it allows direct interaction/inspection with/of all its elements. Everything in Zombie Kernel is an object that can be inspected and changed "live".

Play with it
-------------------
Try it [here](http://davidedc.github.io/Zombie-Kernel-builds/latest/worldWithSystemTestHarness.html)

Download it / build it
-------------------
Install npm. Then install coffeescript. Run the "build_it_please.sh" script. No server needed, just drag "index.html" from the "build" directory into any browser and right click to open a system menu. The "demo" section has some elements that you can play with.

The docs
-------------------
[Here](http://davidedc.github.io/Zombie-Kernel-builds/latest/other-support-files/docs/index.html), it contains an overview of the system, and links to detailed docco files (and more).


Hack it
---------------------------------------------
If you make changes to any of the coffeescript .coffee files in the src directory, just run the script "build_it_please.sh", which will rebuild everything.

Standing on the shoulders of giants
-----------------------------------
Zombie Kernel was inspired by [Lively Kernel](http://www.lively-kernel.org/).
Zombie Kernel was built starting from [Morphic.js](https://github.com/jmoenig/morphic.js) by [Jens MÃ¶nig](https://twitter.com/moenig).
Parts of Zombie Kernel are adapted from the compact and awesome [Cuis Smalltalk](http://www.jvuletich.org/Cuis/Index.html) by [Juan Vuletich](http://www.jvuletich.org/).
