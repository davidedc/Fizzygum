# MenusHelper ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# All "actions" functions for all accessory menu items should belong
# in here. Also helps so we don't pollute moprhs with a varying number
# of helper functions, which is problematic for visual diffing
# on inspectors (the number of methods keeps changing).

class MenusHelper
  # this is so we can create objects from the object class name 
  # (for the deserialization process)
