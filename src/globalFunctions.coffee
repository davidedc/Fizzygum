#    JS versions of all the classes and mixins, plus
#    all the code to build the class hyerarchy and
#    to augment the classes with the correct mixins.
#    So, no compilation of sources is needed for the

  # First loaded batch ----------------------------------------
  #
  # note that we assume that all the parts of this first batch
  # can be loaded/"run" in any order.
  # The only thing that is loaded already is fizzygum-boot.js
  # which is this very file of globals.
  #
  # The advantage of doing this asynchronous loading
  # instead of plainly using script tags in the index
  # is that script tags in the index file tend to load
  # and execute in sequence (because the running of a
  # script could change the html afterwards that loads the
  # others, although browsers can speculatively
  # try to do everything in parallel).
  #
  # By doing this here instead we have exact control of what
  # is loaded and what the logic of the order is, all
  # in one place, and all this loading and parsing can be
  # done in parallel.
  #
  # Note that it's important that none of the code in each
  # of these entries of this batch uses the code of any
  # of the other entries of this batch. E.g. the pre-compiled
  # classes can't instantiate static or non-static properties
  # with, say, the result of running the coffeescript compiler.
  # (when you define a class, all static and nonstatic properties
  #  are immediately initialised so for example doing
  #
  #    myCompiledCode: Coffeescript.compile(...)
  #
  # would run the compilation immediately during the class
  # definition and would hence depend on Coffeescript being
  # loaded already.
  #
  # Note however that since the pre-compiled classes are pre-
  # compiled in the correct dependency order (following the
  # REQUIRES directives), each class *can*
  # initialise static/nonstatic properties with objects
  # created from other classes (as long as the REQUIRES
  # directives are well set). So for example a Morph can
  # initialise a "color" property doing something like
  #
  #   myCol: new Color(...)
  #
  # Also note that we load "Coffeescript" here.
  # Obviously if we don't have the pre-compiled file we need
  # that to create the Morphs and all that is needed to
  # start the world, that's a given.
  # But *also* we need it now if we have the pre-compiled file,
  # that's because actually the Fizzypaint application
  # compiles the paint instruments on start, so we
  # really need to have the Coffeescript compiler on
  # world start if we open the world with Fizzypaint in it.
  # If it wasn't for that, we could
  # postpone the loading of the compiler to after
  # world start.
  #
  # An alternative way of doing things here would be
  # to try to generate at build time a SINGLE big JS file
  # that includes all these parts, and hence loading all in
  # one go.
  # That wouldn't necessarily be more performant but it could
  # be tried.
  # (it could be better to load a few files in parallel
  # and parse them ideally in parallel but I didn't measure
  # that).
