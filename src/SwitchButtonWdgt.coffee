  # WindowWdgt._reactToChildDropped's chrome rebuild) runs in-flush, where the settle-tier's in-flush+orphan
  # AUTO-DEFER (Widget._settleLayoutsAfter: `return coreThunk() if @isOrphan()`) defers automatically -- so no
  # settle leaks into the settle-neutral callback. A top-level `new SwitchButtonWdgt` settles its own orphan.
