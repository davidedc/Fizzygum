# SimpleDocumentScrollPane ////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# this comment below is needed to figure out dependencies between classes
# REQUIRES globalFunctions

# this editor wraps the functionality of the
# SimpleVerticalStackScrollPane into something that has
# a more human name. Also provides additional document-oriented
# features such as "increase/decrease size" etc.
#
# For non-native English speakers: a "pane" is not a "panel"
# a "pane" is a "single sheet of glass". So, it comes
# with no frame, no chrome, no buttons around it.
